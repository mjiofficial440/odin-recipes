    <p>What should I say? Beef Chop In Bangladeshi Style/ গরুর চাপ  is a simple recipe, just need bit of patience to let marinate the meat for enough time. You can marinate the meat up to 2days in your refrigerator. So you can prepare the meat and just fry whenever you want to have.   I like to cook it in mustard oil, but you can use vegetable oil and brush with ghee too for more flavour. Just remember to flatten meat to quarter inch which will make meat more tender, easy to marinate and easy to cook.</p>
